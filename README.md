## A little about me

<p>
The shortest version I can give here is I've been an art director for the last 20 years. I'm coming back to finish a degree that I stop/started a couple times. I've got a ton of experience with the print side of the industry, but not much web/digital other than a few banners, social animation videos, and a handful of landing pages. I would not consider myself technically/analytically inclined, but I love to work on data-driven strategy informed advertising.

I've got some bullet points about me as well listed below.

    🎈 Fun fact ... I have a private license to fly hot air balloons. The weather where I live has been affected by climate change, and there are very few days to safely fly now, so I sold my balloon. But here's a photo of it. <br>

This was my hot air balloon. It was named Guaranteed High.</p>
